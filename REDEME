Title

Beyond static snapshots: An electrochemical simulator reveals how cations steer reaction dynamics at live interfaces

Description

This README accompanies Movie S provided in the Supporting Information.
The movie shows a constant potential molecular dynamics trajectory at the Au–water interface, where alkali metal cations regulate interfacial structure and reactivity. Key phenomena include:

Promotion of CO₂ adsorption by cations

Suppression of hydrogen evolution reaction

Real-time structural fluctuations of water molecules and ions under operating conditions

Notes

The trajectory was generated using the constant potential reactor framework with neural network potentials trained on DFT data.

The visualization was rendered with [insert software, e.g., VMD/OVITO/ASE].

The movie is intended for illustrative purposes only; quantitative analysis is provided in the main text and SI.
