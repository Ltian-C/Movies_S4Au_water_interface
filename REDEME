Real-time molecular dynamics trajectory obtained from constant potential simulations at the Au–water interface, illustrating how alkali metal cations modulate interfacial structure and reaction dynamics. The movie highlights the dynamic adsorption of CO₂ and the concurrent suppression of hydrogen evolution in the presence of cations. Water molecules, ions, and surface atoms are shown explicitly to visualize the structural fluctuations and the evolution of the electrified interface under operating conditions.
