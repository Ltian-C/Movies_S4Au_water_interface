Title

Beyond static snapshots: An electrochemical simulator reveals how cations steer reaction dynamics at live interfaces

Description

This README accompanies Movie S provided in the Supporting Information.
The movie shows a constant potential molecular dynamics trajectory at the Auâ€“water interface, where alkali metal cations regulate interfacial structure and reactivity. 
Key phenomena include:
Real-time structural fluctuations of water molecules and ions under operating conditions
File Information
File name: Movie_S.mp4
Format: MP4 (H.264 codec)
Notes
The trajectory was generated using the constant potential reactor framework with neural network potentials trained on DFT data.
The movie is intended for illustrative purposes only; quantitative analysis is provided in the main text and SI.
